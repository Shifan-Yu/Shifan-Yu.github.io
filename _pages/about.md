Welcome to my webpage!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Finance at <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #2B6CB0;">Lancaster University Management School</a> and a research fellow of the <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/research/areas-of-expertise/centre-for-financial-econometrics-asset-markets-and-macroeconomic-policy/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #2B6CB0;">Centre for Financial Econometrics, Asset Markets and Macroeconomic Policy</a>. 

My research interests are in **financial econometrics**, with a specific focus on high-frequency financial data and their implications for enhanced statistical inference for asset price dynamics and market microstructure.
