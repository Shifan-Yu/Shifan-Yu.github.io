Welcome to my webpage!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Finance at <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #2B6CB0;">Lancaster University Management School</a> and a research fellow of the <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/research/areas-of-expertise/centre-for-financial-econometrics-asset-markets-and-macroeconomic-policy/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #2B6CB0;">Centre for Financial Econometrics, Asset Markets and Macroeconomic Policy</a>. 

My research interests are in **financial econometrics**, with a specific focus on high-frequency financial data and their implications for enhanced statistical inference for asset price dynamics and market microstructure. My research is funded by the North West Social Science Doctoral Training Partnership (<a href="https://nwssdtp.ac.uk/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #2B6CB0;">NWSSDTP</a>) of the Economic and Social Research Council (<a href="https://www.ukri.org/councils/esrc/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #2B6CB0;">ESRC</a>) with an enhanced award in Advanced Quantitative Methods.

I will join the <a href="https://oxford-man.ox.ac.uk/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #2B6CB0;">Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance</a> at the <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #2B6CB0;">University of Oxford</a> as a postdoctoral researcher in September 2024.
